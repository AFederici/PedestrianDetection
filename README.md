# PedestrianDetection
Pedestrian Detection
1) Preprocess Data
2) Create HOG feature vectors of people facing different directions
3) Run component reduction techniques on the data
4) Use an SVM PyTorch model to classify an image as a pedestrian or not
5) Figure out pathing based on the direction a pedestrian is facing.

Steps 1 and 2 are completed in the preprocessing notebook and steps 3 and 4 are in the PyTorch model notebook.
Step 5 will be in its own notebook that hasn't been created yet.
